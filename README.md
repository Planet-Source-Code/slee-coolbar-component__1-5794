## coolbar component


</div>

### Description

well, i've been wanting to use the 'coolbar' component, but couldn't find an example to go by, so i spent an hour and beat it up and figured it out, so i thought i'd make my contribution to PSC in return for all i've learned from the code that others have posted here. the example i made is a mock of IE's URL(address) window with a combobox in the 1st band. in the 2nd band i added a simple mp3 player embedded in a toolbar. hope this helps out others that have been trying to figure the coolbar out....i'm prolly gonna regret this, but if you have any questions on it, email me...enjoy!
